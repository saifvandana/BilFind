## Project Name: BilFind
Group: "The Erudite" / g1D (Section 1 , Group D)
Status: All done except Database Implementations (Text Files used instead)

The Project allows students of Bilkent University to access locations on campus that would 
otherwise not be found on existing map applications. The application also maps places such
as rooms of various academic buildings such as "BZ03" or "EE02". The application also allows
users to save events that can later be viewed and placed on the map.
